Running "jni" module tests (as well as just using this module) requires
being able to load libjvm.so, which requires path to it set via
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. This path is not set automatically
and there is no easy way to guess it, because there can be installed
different implementations of JVM, for one implementation, there can be
different versions, and single version may include different variants
of JVM.

For example, for OpenJDK 7 on x86_64, following may work:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/amd64/server ./run-tests.py jni/*.py
