Extending MicroPython in C
==========================

This chapter describes options for implementing additional functionality in C, but from code
written outside of the main MicroPython repository. The first approach is useful for building
your own custom firmware with some project-specific additional modules or functions that can
be accessed from Python. The second approach is for building modules that can be loaded at runtime.

Please see the :ref:`library section <internals_library>` for more information on building core modules that
live in the main MicroPython repository.
