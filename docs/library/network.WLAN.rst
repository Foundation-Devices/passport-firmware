class WLAN -- control built-in WiFi interfaces
==============================================

This class provides a driver for WiFi network processors.  Example usage::

    import network
    # enable station interface and connect to WiFi access point
    nic = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    nic.active(True)
    nic.connect('your-ssid', 'your-password')
    # now use sockets as usual

Constructors
------------
.. class:: WLAN(interface_id)

Create a WLAN network interface object. Supported interfaces are
``network.STA_IF`` (station aka client, connects to upstream WiFi access
points) and ``network.AP_IF`` (access point, allows other WiFi clients to
connect). Availability of the methods below depends on interface type.
For example, only STA interface may `WLAN.connect()` to an access point.

Methods
-------

.. method:: WLAN.active([is_active])

    Activate ("up") or deactivate ("down") network interface, if boolean
    argument is passed. Otherwise, query current state if no argument is
    provided. Most other methods require active interface.

.. method:: WLAN.connect(ssid=None, password=None, \*, bssid=None)

    Connect to the specified wireless network, using the specified password.
    If *bssid* is given then the connection will be restricted to the
    access-point with that MAC address (the *ssid* must also be specified
    in this case).

.. method:: WLAN.disconnect()

    Disconnect from the currently connected wireless network.

.. method:: WLAN.scan()

    Scan for the available wireless networks.

    Scanning is only possible on STA interface. Returns list of tuples with
    the information about WiFi access points:

        (ssid, bssid, channel, RSSI, authmode, hidden)

    *bssid* is hardware address of an access point, in binary form, returned as
    bytes object. You can use `ubinascii.hexlify()` to convert it to ASCII form.

    There are five values for authmode:

        * 0 -- open
        * 1 -- WEP
        * 2 -- WPA-PSK
        * 3 -- WPA2-PSK
        * 4 -- WPA/WPA2-PSK

    and two for hidden:

        * 0 -- visible
        * 1 -- hidden

.. method:: WLAN.status([param])

    Return the current status of the wireless connection.

    When called with no argument the return value describes the network link status.
    The possible statuses are defined as constants:

        * ``STAT_IDLE`` -- no connection and no activity,
        * ``STAT_CONNECTING`` -- connecting in progress,
        * ``STAT_WRONG_PASSWORD`` -- failed due to incorrect password,
        * ``STAT_NO_AP_FOUND`` -- failed because no access point replied,
        * ``STAT_CONNECT_FAIL`` -- failed due to other problems,
        * ``STAT_GOT_IP`` -- connection successful.

    When called with one argument *param* should be a string naming the status
    parameter to retrieve.  Supported parameters in WiFI STA mode are: ``'rssi'``.

.. method:: WLAN.isconnected()

    In case of STA mode, returns ``True`` if connected to a WiFi access
    point and has a valid IP address.  In AP mode returns ``True`` when a
    station is connected. Returns ``False`` otherwise.

.. method:: WLAN.ifconfig([(ip, subnet, gateway, dns)])

   Get/set IP-level network interface parameters: IP address, subnet mask,
   gateway and DNS server. When called with no arguments, this method returns
   a 4-tuple with the above information. To set the above values, pass a
   4-tuple with the required information.  For example::

    nic.ifconfig(('192.168.0.4', '255.255.255.0', '192.168.0.1', '8.8.8.8'))

.. method:: WLAN.config('param')
.. method:: WLAN.config(param=value, ...)

   Get or set general network interface parameters. These methods allow to work
   with additional parameters beyond standard IP configuration (as dealt with by
   `WLAN.ifconfig()`). These include network-specific and hardware-specific
   parameters. For setting parameters, keyword argument syntax should be used,
   multiple parameters can be set at once. For querying, parameters name should
   be quoted as a string, and only one parameter can be queries at time::

    # Set WiFi access point name (formally known as ESSID) and WiFi channel
    ap.config(essid='My AP', channel=11)
    # Query params one by one
    print(ap.config('essid'))
    print(ap.config('channel'))

   Following are commonly supported parameters (availability of a specific parameter
   depends on network technology type, driver, and `MicroPython port`).

   =============  ===========
   Parameter      Description
   =============  ===========
   mac            MAC address (bytes)
   essid          WiFi access point name (string)
   channel        WiFi channel (integer)
   hidden         Whether ESSID is hidden (boolean)
   authmode       Authentication mode supported (enumeration, see module constants)
   password       Access password (string)
   dhcp_hostname  The DHCP hostname to use
